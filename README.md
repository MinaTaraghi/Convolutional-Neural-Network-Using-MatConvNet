# Convolutional Neural Network Using MatConvNet
 CNN using MatConvNet Library for MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits Classification

Convolutional Neural Network using MatConvNet Library version 1.0-beta17
The library folder (matconvnet-1.0-beta17) should be copied in the root folder for Matlab to access and the code to work

The MNIST Dataset of hand-written digits can be accessed here:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
The Train and Test Datasets should be extracted and be present in the root folder as follows:
 - train-images-idx3-ubyte
 - train-labels-idx1-ubyte
 - t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
 - t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte

There are a number of parameters and options that can be decided on by the user through the GUI:
 - Number of Stages in CNN (up to 4)
 - The filter number and filter size for each stage
 - Convolution Layer Stride and Pooling Layer Stride
 - Pooling Function (Maximum, Average)
 - Number of training epochs
 - Batch size
 - Learning rate
 
The energy function and Error rate for training samples as well as Sample graphical outputs of different layers are displayed.
